# **General Description of the Project**
In this project, we are planning to create a mobile app which both students and club managers can use. Students will be able to see all the club events, search the events by name and filter them. Also, they can follow & join clubs and get notifications about upcoming events. On the other side, club managers will be able to create, update and cancel  their club events. Moreover, they can accept join requests coming from students and assign positions to club members.
